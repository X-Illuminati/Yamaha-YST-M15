# Yamaha-YST-M15
3D model of a Yamaha desktop speaker model YST-M15

## Status
I modeled this speaker in order to create a 3D-printed bracket for it.  
The .FCStd files are FreeCAD documents.   
The .stl files should be openable with nearly any 3D CAD tool.

The main file for the YST-M15 speaker is [speaker-model.stl](speaker-model.stl).  
Some other files are provided for references.

## License
These models may be covered by design patents held by Yamaha.
However, I expect any such patents should be expired quite a long time ago.
